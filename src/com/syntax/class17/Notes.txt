Access modifiers:
Keywords which control the access of members of class(fields/methods/constructors)
We have four access levels in java and three keywords to control these access levels
private protected default(which is not a keyword) public
1) private:
if we write private keyword with any class member it can be accessed only in that
class
2) default:
if we do not write any keyword with class members we can access those members inside
the same class and in any other class inside the same package.
3) public:
if we use public keyword with any class member that member is accessible everywhere
in the project
Best practices:
always try to declare the fields as private
most of the methods are declared as public
