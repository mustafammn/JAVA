Constructors:
is special block of code that help us build/construct(giving initial values
to the fields) the object
1) when we write new ClassName() this is the code that executes the constructor for
that class
2) when we do not write a constructor a default constructor is provided by java
compiler
3) If there are multiple constructors in a class java will check the number of
parameters type of parameters and sequence of parameters

Rules:
1) Constructors have same name as the class name
2) Constructors don't have return types not even void
3)we can use "this" keyword with parentheses to invoke the other constructors of the same class
this:
this can be used to differentiate local and instance variables
