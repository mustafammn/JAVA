Inheritance:
is a mechanism in which one class acquires all the properties and behaviors/methods of parent class
except private members(fields/methods) and constructors
we use extends keyword to inherit from a class.
Benefits:
1) Saves time to code
2) it takes less memory
3) Execution time is less
4) code duplication is reduced
Disadvantages:
1)  In Inheritance base class and child class,
both are tightly coupled. Hence, If you change the code of parent class,
it will affect all the child classes.
Types of inheritance:
There are 4 major types of inheritance which supported in most of OOP languages
but java ony supports 3 types with class
1) single ,hierarchical ,multilevel,
multiple(not supported by classes in java because of diamond problem)
single inheritance:
if we have only one parent and one child class its called single inheritance.
public class Parent{
}
public class Child extends Parent{
}
Hierarchical:
if we have one parent class and multiple children classes then it is called
Hierarchical
public class Parent{
}
public class Child1 extends Parent{
}
public class Child2 extends Parent{
}
public class Child3 extends Parent{
}
Multilevel:
A class extends from another class that is already extended from another class
public class GrandParent{
}

public class Parent extends GrandParent{
}

class Child extends Parent{

}
Multiple(not supported by java classes):
one child and multiple parents
public class Parent1{
void print name(){
sout"Parent1"
}
}

public class Parent2{
void print name(){
sout"Parent2"
}
}

public class Child extends Parent1,Parent2{
}
