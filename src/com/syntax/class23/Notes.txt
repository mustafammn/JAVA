final is a keyword in java that we can use with classes fields and methods.
Its non access modifier.
1) when used with classes those classes can not be inherited to prevent
overuse of inheritance.
2) when used with methods that method can not be overridden in child classes.
3) when used with fields we can not change the value of that field.
