Wrapper classes:
    Wrapper classes are object classes around primitive data
    types that have built-in methods and are used as objects where necessary.
    for example in collections framework.
    Wrapper classes provides us a mechanism to use primitive data types as objects
Boxing
    The conversion of primitive data types into its
    equivalent Wrapper is called boxing
    for example
    Integer i=new Integer(10); // boxing
AutoBoxing
    The automatic conversion of primitive data types into its
    equivalent Wrapper is called autoboxing
    Integer i=10; //autoboxing

Unboxing:
    The conversion of equivalent Wrapper to primitive data types
     is called unboxing
     Integer i=new Integer(10);//boxing
     int i2=i.valueOf() //unboxing

AutoUnboxing:
     The conversion of equivalent Wrapper to primitive data types
     is called unboxing
     Integer i=10; //autoboxing
     int i2=i //auto unboxing
collection framework
    Collection provides architecture to store and manipulate the
    group of objects that represented as a single unit
    we have many interfaces and classes inside the framework to achieve this.
    ArrayList
    <> diamond operator is used to specify the data type in collections framework.
    ArrayList<Double> numbers=new ArrayList<>();
    add()-- adds the element to the arraylist
