Maps:
Maps are data structure that can store the data in the form of key value pair.
There are three famous types of maps
1) HashMap
2) LinkedHashmap
3) TreeMap
HashMap:

Insertion order is not maintained when we need good performance, and we don't care about the
order of the data we should use Hashmap.
LinkedHashmap:

Insertion order is maintained, but it is slower when it comes to retrieve the data
as compared to  a hashmap but better insertion speed
than treeMaps. When we need to maintain the insertion order of the data.
TreeMaps:
TreeMaps store the data in sorted form insertion is slow because treemap has to compare
the data with existing elements' that's why insertion is slow but retrieval is fast.
==============================================================
To Read the data from a file we must have below things.
1) Path(Location) of that file on our computer
2) Appropriate program must be installed on the computer to read the data from that file
for example for xlsx we use Microsoft Excel for .pdf files we can use Adobe Reader for .txt
files we can use NotePad etc.
3) We must also know a little about the structure of that file for example in Excel files
data is stored in the form of workbooks inside workbooks we have sheets inside sheets we
have rows and column or cells or column.
Why we should learn about fileHandling in java
Why store sensitive data in  files instead of code so that no one can access that data
    1) we write the code inside java programs to read that info at run time from some kind of files
    perform the testing and once testing is done we delete those files.
    2) when we have to test web forms we don't putt all the testing data inside the code
    we create files for that read the data from those files and test those web forms.
