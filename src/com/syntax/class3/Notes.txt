what are variables:
variables are boxes in the computer memory that hold values.
what data types?
datatype is mechanism that defines what type of values a variable can store and what type
of operations we can perform on that data.
String concatenation?
using String concatenation we can combine or attach a value with String
String var1="Hello world";
int number1=10;
String result=var1+number1=>Hello world10
To perform concatenation only one variable needs to be a String the other variable can be
of any data type like boolean int char String etc.
Arithmetic operators.
+ - * / %
we use + to perform addition or concatenation
we use - to perform subtraction
we use * to multiplication
we use / for division
we use % to get the remainder
