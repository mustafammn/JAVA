Why learn fileHandling in Java:
    1) Putting sensitive info inside the code is not a good idea because everyone
    who has the access to the code will be able to see them
    2) Every  time we test our applications on different environment we have
    to change the code to update the credentials It's also not an idea and can introduce
    bugs
    We will be discussing two types of files
1)Properties file
2) Excel files
Properties file
Data is stored in the form of key value pairs
To read the data from any file
    we should know the path then we can use FileInputStream class to load that file
    inside java program
FileInputStream
loads the data inside the program in the form of bytes
Properties.load() method data is converted to key value pairs,
and we can use the methods from Map interface to read and write the data.
