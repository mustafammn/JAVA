Sets:
    Sets in java are special data structures that do not allow duplicate elements
    There are three main types of Sets
    1) Hashset
    2) LinkedHashset
    3) TreeHashset
HashSet:
    Fast but no insertion order
LinkedHashset:
    Slower than Hashset but retains insertion order
TreeSet:
    Sorts the elements in natural order.
===============================================================
Map is a data structure that stores the element in the form of key value
paris
Most famous type of maps are
1) HashMap
2) LinkedHashMap
3) TreeMap
4) HashTable
HashMap:
Insertion order is not maintained but they are the fastest most widely used.
LinkedHashMap
Maintains the insertion order but are slower than Hashmaps
TreeMap
Sorts the data based on keys insertion is very slow but retrieval is comparable to Hashmap.
HashTable
HashTables are thread safe
====================================================
FileHandling
Reading manipulating and writing data to files is called File Handling in java
Path=location of that file on our computer
if we want to read the data from files we need FileInputStream
if we want to write the data to files we use FileOutputStream
